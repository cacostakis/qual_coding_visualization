You know all this is play based but these ones are saying we implement it this way the other partner is saying we implement it this way so why don’t you up there do you know like harmonization and then we come and agree to say this but we say no these are partners that coming with their own research, these ones researched in UK, tried it in sunshine so we personally I would love to say that so that ministry should also have integrated otherwise sometimes we look like we don’t know what we are doing, we are sending 2,3,4 partners on the ground or sometimes we even go with them but we can’t say we are doing the same things by the time realize we say let’s harmonize we would have been seen like we are disorganized to say the least so, yeah we want to look organized because we know to say this concept is working or it worked or we researched on this one together with our partners so this is the road map this is how we are going to implement it after all we are all interested in improving ahhh class room practice, isn’t it?",respondent,NA,NA,Improvements /Recs,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Not confuse teachers with different programs / align across NGO work
